### Deploying your site

To run your code locally, go to the source folder and run

```
    gulp serve
```

and then go to browser and open http://wwww.localhost:3000/.

To deploy your site, simply run the following command from your project directory:

```
    firebase deploy
```

This will deploy your project to <YOUR-FIREBASE-APP>.firebaseapp.com. In the next section, we'll walk through using a custom domain with Firebase Hosting.
